# Analytics Tag Check

## Overview

To help Twitter and our partners confirm correct installation of Twitter Conversion Tracking tags, this Chrome Extension checks whether 
advertisers have setup the tags correctly. This tool provides a simple visual indicator in the location bar, as well as additionally 
debugging information and history tracking logging.

## Usage

<img src="images/location.png" style="width: 70%;"/>

This indicates that the pixel is loading properly. Furthermore, if you click on the bird you get some further information about the tag:

Lastly, if you click on the history icon, you will see a historical list of all pages you have visited that the Twitter Conversion Tracking
tags have appeared.
